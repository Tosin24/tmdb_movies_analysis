## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze a dataset from the movie database (TMDb) and then communicate the findings about it. I will use Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for the analysis.

The Movie Database (TMDb) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows. The project was founded in 2008 by Travis Bell to collect film posters. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The data set contains 10866 rows and 21 columns.

For the analysis of this data set, the following questions was explored:
- Is the popularity of a movie dependent on the budget of the production?
- Does a high budget movie guarantees an equally higher revenue?
-  Does the release year of a movie affects its revenue?
